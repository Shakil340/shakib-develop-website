                            Having problem of bad exposure, unwanted background problem, problem of superfluous color
                            effects, etc. in your photos? Donâ€™t worry more, we at graphicsdesignpoint has come to you

                            problems. Such as image masking techniques which can be fixed almost anything for you. Image
                            masking has become very urgent to process complex images in photo editing, especially for
                            product catalogues,
                            brochures, magazines, calendars, poster, photographs use for online shops and more. Masking
                            technique is not at all a simple task rather it is a very time consuming and eye straining.
                            Our designers have the
                            capability and vast experience to do not only perfectly but also accurate. We can mask your
                            ordinary images in such a way that the viewers can have the actual look and feel of the
                            product through its
                            sharpness.

                            Image quality models usually include a mechanism whereby artifacts are masked by the image
                            acting as a background. Scientific study of visual masking has followed two traditions:
                            contrast masking and noise
                            masking, depending primarily on whether the mask is deterministic or random. In the former
                            traditio n, masking is explained by a decrease in the effective gain of the early visual
                            system. In the latter
                            tradition, masking is explained by an increased variance in some internal decision variable.
                            The masking process in image quality models is usually of the gain-control variety, derived
                            from the contrast
                            masking tradition. In this paper we describe a third type of masking, which I call entropy
                            masking, that arises when the mask is deterministic but unfamiliar. Some properties and
                            implication of entropy
                            masking are discussed. We argue that image quality models should incorporate entropy
                            masking, as well as contrast masking.

                            Man always has a thirst for acquiring new knowledge and ideas. To fulfill this thirst, we
                            arrange a
                            short way by which we can mask an image in Photoshop. By doing the following activities, we
                            can mask
                            an image of
                            model according to our own efforts.At first we must open Photoshop in our computer and
                            select the
                            image. When the whole photo is opened, we should path the image using clipping tools. Then
                            we should
                            select the area
                            which we want to mask or earser. Suppose, if we mask the hair portion of a model we will
                            draws a
                            path round the hair. After that, we should take a new layer and select the color. We should
                            always
                            remember that we
                            used to select indigo or green color because they are the best color for image masking. Now
                            we
                            should select the background masking tools. It should be remembered that the layer 1 must be
                            selected. So we should bear
                            in mind that the options are looked after at the time of image masking. It is also necessary
                            to know
                            when we are masking the hair area, we should depend on the tolerance
