                            correctly
                            because of few reasons such as shortage of light or the sun rays. In this situation, we need
                            image color adjustment. This color adjustment is called image color correction.Everybody has
                            an
                            enquiry how we can adjust our image color using the tools of Adobe Photoshop. Following the
                            steps, we can easily correction our image color. For this, we should do the following:</p>
                        <p> t first we run our computer and open Photoshop. Now we should select the image part which
                            area
                            we want to adjust the color or correction the image color. After selecting the part of the
                            image, we can change our image color according to our willingly. But we must remember that
                            before starting image color correction we should clipping path the image. By pathing and
                            selecting the area of the image we should use fether 1 or 2. Doing these we can adjust white
                            or
                            black image’s color using curves or levels tool.</p>
