                    <h3> Digital image manipulation</h3>
                    <p>     Digital image manipulation is widely used for e-commerce websites. They need to show the product neat, clean, and
                        brightly in their e-stores. If distracting backgrounds, objects, shades are present in their product images, it
                        fails to convey the details of the products to the customers. The same thing happens when the image is underexposed,
                        overexposed, or imperfectly composed while photographing. A visitor generally becomes unimpressed with these types
                        of images. They tend to skip those products to take into consideration. But it is possible to remove these flaws
                        with the various techniques of digital image editing or image manipulation.
                    </p>
