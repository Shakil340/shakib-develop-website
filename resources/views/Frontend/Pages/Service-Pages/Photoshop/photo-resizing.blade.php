                            capable
                            of less serious pursuits, such as editing a photo of your friend so his head is several
                            times
                            larger than it actually is. It's not a hard thing to do, but it will take some works,
                            especially

                        <h3> Why it is important to resize image?</h3>
                        <p>The reason why you should resize images if you plan to load images to the Internet for
                            display
                            on a web page or for inserting into a presentation is that image file size matters. On the
                            web,
                            the larger the image size the longer it will take the web page to load.</p>


                        <h3>What is the main purpose for resizing a photo?</h3>
                        <p> Resizing can help your photo fit into a certain space on a screen, such as in a blog post or
                            social media post. Smaller images weigh less than larger ones, which can be important for
                            making
                            an uploading process faster or taking up less storage room on your devices.</p>
