                    <p> How to retouch an image? It is a general search of us that how to retouch an image. We can
                        retouch an image just using Adobe Photoshop tools. To retouch an image we can use three types of
                        tools. They are healing brush tool, clone stamp tool and patch tool. But they are used in
                        different fields. Healing brush tool: this type of tool is used where only one color is found.
                        If any image has several color but the trace or spot are found in one color. In this satiation,
                        we can use healing brush tool. Clone stamp tool: if we remove any kind of spot, reflection,
                        ideograph, impression or trace between twice colors, we must use clone stamp tool. Otherwise our
                        image can be damaged. Patch brush tool: this type of tool is used in the same category of
                        healing brush tool. But using this tool we can easily retouch any kind of small or big spot,
                        reflection, ideograph, impression or trace etc. Image retouching is an embroidery art that
                        requires an inherent streak of creativity. Creativity born out of experience and handling the
